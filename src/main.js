/*Tre Braswell, Eric Suzuki, and Ixel Camacho
Game Title: Yarny
5-3-20
Tre:Technically Interesting: I created a scaling feature that scaled the texture atlas depending on whether the player collected the button or a pin. The different sizes had different collision and velocity. I think this is technically interesting because i had to learn about scale and managing prefabs assets in between scenes.
Ixel:Visual Style: Soft and charming theme with a hint of anime style to the character; the simple art captures adorableness, making you root for the yarn boy. Every art asset created is related to a color palette of dark and bright purple shades with the concept of sewing and yarn. The music, also, is created to make a childhood atmosphere with musical, fun sound effects.
